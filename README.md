# CSC-790- AI for Health

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 1** of the **CSC-790** course (AI for Health).  
The project focuses on predicting **Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM)** using machine learning and Deep learning models, addressing issues like class imbalance and model interpretability.

## Description of the work

For Ml and Dl models
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection using statistical tests
- Handling extreme class imbalance
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model training (ANN, ResNet)
- Evaluation using metrics like **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**
- Hyperparameter tuning


### To run the code 



#### Option 1: If using google drive 

1. Keep the dataset on this path:
    path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/AIforHealth/Assignment1/SMM.csv'
   
#### Option 2 : If using local or cluster

1. Keep the dataset on path : '/home/username/csc790project/AI HW1/data/SMM.csv'

**Choose either option and run the corressponding jupyter cell.**

* For option 1: cell 1 and 2
* For option 2: cell 3


### Necessaries Dependencies

Tensorflow,sklearn,imlearn,torch
